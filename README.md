# dhnt

dhnt is not created to be just yet another language but rather it is intended to be one that will transform all languages and dialects - programming, constructed, or natural - into one unified language.

It is designed to be easy to learn (as easy as in a few minutes) and hard to forget (for the rest of your life) contrary to any other languages.

In summary:

- dhnt takes 26 characters from UTF-8 for its alphabet: abcd efgh ijklmn opqrst uvwxyz
- dhnt is tam-less (tense, aspect, mood) and inflection free.
- dhnt vocabulary encompasses all words from all other languages after transformation.
